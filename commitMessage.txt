feat: Add visual radar display with real-time aircraft tracking
Visual Radar Screen Implementation

Implemented 80x30 character ASCII radar screen with proper coordinate system
Added world-to-screen coordinate conversion (NM to character grid positioning)
Real-time display updates every radar sweep with aircraft position tracking
Scale: 2 nautical miles per character for realistic distance representation


Directional Indicators:

> = Flying East (heading 315°-44°)
v = Flying South (heading 45°-134°)
< = Flying West (heading 135°-224°)
^ = Flying North (heading 225°-314°)

Range Ring System:

Inner ring (.) = 10 nautical miles from radar center
Outer ring (.) = 20 nautical miles from radar center
Center point (*) = Radar control tower location(Center)
