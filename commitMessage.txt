feat: Add comprehensive aircraft state management with ICAO safety standards; Used Ada's safety-critical features

- Implement strong typing with aviation-specific constraints
- Add aircraft categories, flight phases, and transponder codes  
- Integrate ICAO separation standards including RVSM and wake turbulence
- Added exception handling for aviation safety
- Enhance radar display with ATC formatting
- Implement realistic aircraft movement with vertical rates
- Used Ada's custom exceptions for aviation-specific errors
- Used Ada's constrained subtypes preventing invalid states
